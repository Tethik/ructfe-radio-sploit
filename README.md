# RUCTFE 2019 Radio Exploit / Writeup

This was the exploit I used to capture flags from the Radio service.
I noticed early on that the JWT Secret was generated in a predictable way. The following script was
used to generate the secret key used to sign the JWT.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

generate_key() {
    declare -r key_path=$1
    echo "$(date +\"%s\")$key_path"
    echo -n "$(date +\"%s\")$key_path" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}' > $key_path
}

declare -r jwt_secret_path="${SECRET_PATH%/}/jwt_secret"
declare -r session_key="${SECRET_PATH%/}/session_key"

generate_key $jwt_secret_path
generate_key $session_key
```

Problem here is the `"$(date +\"%s\")$key_path"` that is fed to sha256sum. It's easy to bruteforce too, only requiring a few thousand offline attempts.

In turn the code that generated the actual JWT was this module, which suspiciously called a `radio-auth.so` plugin. This was where the above secret was passed in to.
```go
package auth

import (
	"fmt"
	"plugin"
)

const pluginName = "./radio-auth.so"

type EncodeFn = func(interface{}) string
type DecodeFn = func(string, interface{}) error
type InitAuthFn = func(string)

var Encode EncodeFn
var Decode DecodeFn

func InitAuth(init string) (err error) {
	var plug *plugin.Plugin
	if plug, err = plugin.Open(pluginName); err != nil {
		return
	}
	var encodeFnSym, decodeFnSym, initAuthSym plugin.Symbol
	if encodeFnSym, err = plug.Lookup("Encode"); err != nil {
		return
	}
	if decodeFnSym, err = plug.Lookup("Decode"); err != nil {
		return
	}
	var ok bool
	if Encode, ok = encodeFnSym.(EncodeFn); !ok {
		return fmt.Errorf("Can't read encode function from auth module")
	}
	if Decode, ok = decodeFnSym.(DecodeFn); !ok {
		return fmt.Errorf("Can't read encode function from auth module")
	}
	if initAuthSym, err = plug.Lookup("InitAuth"); err != nil {
		return
	}
	var initFn InitAuthFn
	if initFn, ok = initAuthSym.(InitAuthFn); !ok {
		return fmt.Errorf("Can't read InitAuth function from auth module")
	}
	initFn(init)
	return
}
```

Using https://jwt.io/ I saw that the JWT generated had a weird "alg" field set to `42`. So there was clearly something fishy going on there.

To patch I initially changed the secret where it was generated by just adding a random string.

The exploit then ran as follows:
1. Register new user (`/frontend-api/register/`), log in (`/frontend-api/login/`) and create a api token (`/api/v1/token/`). I pipelined this to all hosts with the `register.py` script which I ran once to a list of JWT tokens for every host responding.
2. Take the API token, and bruteforce it with the `radio-auth.so` plugin. I wrote the `crack` golang program for this. I was surprised how quick it was to bruteforce all ~103 hosts. With this I have a list of each service + secret used to sign the JWT using `radio-auth.so`.
3. With the now known secret+hosts, my attack was to visit the `/frontend-api/our-users/` route, get the last 20 users, then for each user spoof a JWT with the `sign`-golang and get their playlists from `/api/v1/playlist/`. If I was lucky, there would be a flag in the playlist description. The `exfil.py` combined all the steps and would submit flags if found. 

Probably it would have been smart to reverse `radio-auth.so` and figure out what it actually does. I'm not confident in my reversing skills though, so I thought this would take too long.

Because we were still getting pwned, to mitigate it fully I replaced the entire JWT signing/parsing mechanism. This took a bit too long though, and most likely they were using another vulnerability.

The only optimization I did here was to pipeline the process. In the end I just ran 4 `exfil.py` worker scripts on different target lists. It could also happen that a restart of any of the target services would have 

## Another vuln

Our service still continued to get exploited though, I'm pretty sure the following "share hash" on the playlist was abused. Also what I saw a lot of spam too in the logs. In the very last minute I uploaded a fix which added a salt though. It's the thought that matters.

```go
func (p *Playlist) HS() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%x", sha256.Sum256([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("playlist:{%d}:{%t}:{%d}:{&b}", p.ID, p.Private, p.UserID))))
}
```
